story: >-
  The idea for Corner Project started many years ago when Tom and Chris were in
  their late teens. The two brothers envisioned opening a local establishment
  where people of all walks of life would come together to enjoy a beverage and
  a bite to eat. Both went off to college to study subjects that had little to
  do with their dreams of opening their establishment.


  In 2005, Tom left a career in social work to attend culinary school and a few years later, Chris began brewing beer on his stove-top. In early 2017 the two of them revisited their dream in a more serious mindset and brought the concept of Corner Project to fruition.
